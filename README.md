# ZemogaTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

## Development server

First run `nmp install` to build the node_modules.

The run `nmp start` to run the project in dev server. Mock Api REST server built with json-server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To view the project make sure to be on the `master` branch. Both layout and interactive part were built simultaneously and depend on each other so I thought there was no need to create two sepperate branches as the excercise suggested.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
